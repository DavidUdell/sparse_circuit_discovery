## Installation
To manually install, just run these two commands in the shell:

```git clone https://github.com/DavidUdell/sparse_circuit_discovery```

```pip install --editable sparse_circuit_discovery```

_Alternatively,_ I have a Docker image [hosted on
DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/davidudell/sparse_circuit_discovery/general).
The Docker image is especially good for pulling to a remote server.
